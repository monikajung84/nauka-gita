                    For to gaze awhile <br>
                    Upon the fields of barley <br>
                    In his arms she fell as her hair came down <br>

                    Upon the fields of barley <br>
                    Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth <br>

                    But I swear in the days still left <br>

                    Among the fields of barley <br>
                    See the children run as the sun goes down <br>
